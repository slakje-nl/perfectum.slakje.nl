# perfectum.slakje.nl

The purpose of this repository is to serve [perfectum.slakje.nl](https://perfectum.slakje.nl),
a small tool designed to help users learn the past tenses of Dutch verbs. It also includes
a Polish translation, though you can fully use the tool without any knowledge of Polish.

All improvements are warmly welcomed! As a backend software engineer, I work on UI projects
like this one just for fun, so it may not reflect the latest UI trends (and if it does, I'm sorry,
didn't mean to!).
